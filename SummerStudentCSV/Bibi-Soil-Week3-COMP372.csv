0,0,This week after a group discussion we set up a Slack channel with Eric so that the whole group can pitch questions to them when they come up with them rather than constant emailing.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

20,20,Roro is working on the database and is current able to do API calls but not with the MSHA data yet but this shouldn't be far off so then we'll be able to start getting the data to the map and displaying it.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
