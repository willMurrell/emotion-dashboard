1,1,I'm very sorry about the late blog post.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,2,I have been focused over the weekend until now on a project milestone for info202 and I got stuck on trying to figure out something in Java and completely forgot to write it.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,3,The week has been very productive though.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4,4,The sprint for me was pretty much perfect time predictions for my total task.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5,5,I may have spent 3-4 hours longer than our planning poker predicted (i didnt really count) but it felt pretty close to about 15 hours total to go from nothing to a working API call with all the required parameters and a parsed string to pass on the rabbitMQ.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,6,However we anticipated having to create an OAuth client in the planning but i was able to get a permissioned access token with the particle CLI.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

8,8,I changed to using the node-fetch API module after some further reading which was very intuitive and let me write a loop and if statement for the offline objects and their last online time and wrap it all in a configurable poll function as per the brief.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
