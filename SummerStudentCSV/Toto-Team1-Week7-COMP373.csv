1,1,We had a meeting with Jeramiah on Wednesday afternoon and had planned out to sort out the overlapping box thing along with a few others but we didn't make it.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,2,We have since fixed some things including the overlapping box but still since we didn't get it done for the final presentation it was a bit of a shame.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3,3,The problem with it was down to just basic mistakes like using the wrong types to compare in the if statements about whether the coordinates from the region in the bounding box were there.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

9,9,I feel like I have invested enough time into to understand how its working now so it might be worth working on it a little bit before the internship.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
