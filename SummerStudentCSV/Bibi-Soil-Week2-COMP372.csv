1,1,It seems we are still unsure of what language exactly the parser is going to be in but I think the team is thinking of having it as a python script that checks the servers directory for new CSV files to parse every so often.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

11,11,I'm not sure the current tutorial I'm working through will give us the result I'm looking for as it seems to suggest that there will be a DB instance that can only be connected to by a web page on the EC2 server that sits on the same private cloud.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
