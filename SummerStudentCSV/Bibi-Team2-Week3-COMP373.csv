0,0,Context: This project is to create a solution for the Southern District Health Board that will allow them to easily update their senior doctors salaries.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1,1,The salaries are updated when: It's the anniversary of their fellowshipAnnual pay increase through their newly agreed upon MECA (Multi Employer Collective Agreement)When a doctor joins or leaves a team (the whole teams on-call hours thus their pay gets adjusted)It is preferable to have as many of these processes automated as possible.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4,4,We started off this week with meeting Milair for our client meeting.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5,5,There were many details to go over for this project which could quite easily get out of hand if we aren't careful.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6,6,I think we have a decent grasp of the problem at hand and we should be able to produce something to provide some value to the client.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7,7,We did some research and found out that some of the other district health boards are also using excel spread sheets for their REM schedules.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8,8,Further inquiries could also be made to the health boards we haven't heard from yet.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9,9,We should also continue researching other software solutions and check that such a product doesn't already exist.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

11,11,Having a MySQL relational database to store and group the doctors into their teams.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
12,12,"We need to be very certain that the results of our solution are accurate, if it's not it could potentially cost the client a lot of money, so we need to ensure proper testing is done throughout the life-cycle of development.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
13,13,"This week, besides the work on the poster, I started working on the ERD for the database, trying to make it as flexible as possible so that it would accommodate the many edge-cases of how salaries are updated.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14,14,I have no doubt the ERD will continue to evolve over the life-cycle of the project as we discover more edge-cases or realize that some have been missed out but currently we think this covers enough for us to start working and testing on.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
