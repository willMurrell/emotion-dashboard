4,4,There's been lots of research on super pixels and overall algorithms in papers and docs and it seems to be yielding some progress in our understanding of what the project is going to take.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

6,6,I think everything is going pretty good but for me the research on how to work with python/matplotlib/skimage for images in a GUI is a bit hard to pin down but i'm learning a lot.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
