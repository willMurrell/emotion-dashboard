8,8,For the actions i should have done differently Im not really sure i just went really hard trying to fix opencv however i could but maybe just reading more articles when it didnt work the first time would have helped me solve it quicker.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

11,11,Anyway i am just going to do my best to get something good done by the end of the week but i also need to catch up on my paper as i might be in a bit of a risky spot with the marks for that too and i definitely don't wont to fail it either.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
