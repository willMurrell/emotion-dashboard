4,4,We talked with them and mentioned that with our limited time left that we wouldn't be able to complete all of the functionalities to make this work but at this point we are fairly invested in the project and we can see how much of a difference it will make for them so we all agreed to keep working on it even though we have no academic obligation to.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

10,10,It probably would have been beneficial to do more research into UI frameworks and figure out how to use MVVM within WPF properly.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
11,11,It would have been easier for us to learn MVVM started with a small project or use more incremental development of the UI rather than build up the UI and then try make MVVM match that.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
